# SwipePad Themes

From version 0.9.16, SwipePad becomes themeable. We made an example theme and put its sources here.
You may [download it from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.calciumion.swipepad.theme.example).

You are more than welcome to make your own theme. After you published it on Google Play, feel free to contact us to put you here so more people could see it.
